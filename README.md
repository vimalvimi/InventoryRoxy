Inventory App - UDACITY - NANODEGREE - Roxy

The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of 
its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and 
a picture of the product. It will also need to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for 
the user to order more from the listed supplier.
